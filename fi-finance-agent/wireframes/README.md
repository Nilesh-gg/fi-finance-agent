## Viewing the Wireframes

To view the wireframes:
1. Open any `.html` file in a web browser
2. Each wireframe is self-contained with inline CSS
3. Wireframes are labeled and annotated for clarity
4. Interactive elements are styled to show hover/active states

## Implementation Notes

These wireframes serve as a blueprint for the React frontend implementation. Key considerations for development:

1. **Component Structure**: Each wireframe section can be implemented as reusable React components
2. **State Management**: Consider Redux or Context API for managing financial data and AI conversation state
3. **API Integration**: Components should be designed to easily integrate with the backend API endpoints
4. **Testing**: Wireframes provide clear user scenarios for automated testing
5. **Performance**: Large datasets (transactions, holdings) should implement virtual scrolling or pagination

## Feedback and Iteration

These wireframes are designed to be iterative. Key areas for potential refinement:
- User testing feedback on AI conversation flow
- Performance optimization for mobile devices
- Accessibility improvements based on user needs
- Integration feedback from Fi MCP server testing
